NAME
  mkbmark -- generate bookmark aliases for shell and vifm


DESCRIPTION
  The mkbmark utility shall generate bookmark aliases for the shell and vifm.
  Other applications may be added as targets in the future.

  The utility shall read information from stdin. Empty lines and lines beginning
  with any character, that isn’t alphanumeric, will be ignored. The remaining
  lines are treated as input as follows.

  The utility shall read pairs of Symbols and Paths from stdin.
  
  The Symbols shall be made only of alphanumeric characters.
  
  The Paths must denote a directory on the host filesystem. The Paths may be in
  one of two forms:
  
    (1)	 Absolute Paths beginning with a '/'
    (2)	 Home Paths beginning with '$HOME'

  Paths in the first form shall be treated as absolute paths on the filesystem.

  Paths in the second form shall be treated as relative to the user's home
  directory. Specifically, the string '$HOME' at the beginning of the path shall
  be replaced with the absolute path to the user's home directory.

  This is the only expansion the utility shall commence.
  
  There may be white space between the Symbol and the Path. This is done for
  readability purposes:
  
    <Symbol>        <Path>
    <Long Symbol>   <Path>
    <Symbol>        <Path>

  The utility shall output an error message on stdout, if only a Symbol was
  provided or if no Path could be recognized.
  
  It is left to the user to insure, that the Paths are escaped correctly for
  use within double quotes in the outputs. Double quotes are used in the
  output to insure compatibility with paths containing (escaped) double quotes.
  
  Note, that vifm does not perform expansion on strings. Note also, that
  aliases are not expanded either, which means no shell expansion is
  performed by the consumer programs.
  
  For each line of input the utility shall compute the strings resulting from
  the following printf statements.
  
       <n>  <statement>
       (1)  printf "alias cd%s=\"cd \\\"%s\"\"\n",         <symbol>, <path>
       (2)  printf "alias cc%s=\"cd \\\"%s\"; vifm .\"\n", <symbol>, <path>
       (3)  printf "bmark! \"%s/\" %s\n",                  <path>, <symbol>
  
  The output of the nth statement shall be appended to the nth output file,
  which are as follows:
  
       <n>  <file name>
       (1)  bmark-cd
       (2)  bmark-cd_vifm
       (3)  bmark-vifm
  
  Note, that all of these are paths in mkbmark’s working directory.
  
  No mechanic for overriding the output files is specified. Implementations
  may choose to provide one.

USAGE WITH VIFM

     Vifm seems not to like to use :source to read a bookmarks file from the
     vifmrc. You may manunually source the bookmarks instead. Use

	  :delbmarks!			     to remove all bookmarks
	  :source ~/.bookmarks/bmark-vifm    to source the bookmarks

MAIN IMPLEMENTATION
     The utility shall be implemented as an awk program.

     The implementation shall get the user's home folder in the BEGIN block.

     The implementation shall first skip comment lines.

     The implementation shall match against valid input lines and handle them as
     follows: perform the $HOME-substitution using gsub(), then use substr() and
     index() functions to extract the symbol and trim it using sub(), and the
     path for use with the specified printf statements.

     The implementation shall catch all remaining lines and output an
     appropriate error message.

     On each line the printf statements shall be executed as specified above,
     their output shall be redirected into the corresponding output file.

EXTENSIONS
     To extend the utility in the future, add a new printf statement and default
     to the specification; then add the printf statement and default output file
     to the implementation according to the IMPLEMENTATION specifications.

EXAMPLES

     Basic Usage

          $> mkbmark . . VIFM_bookmarks <<END
          u   $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4
          st  $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik
          sts $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/st-ss20-harder-heinen
          stm $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/materialien
          END

     will create the following output files (where $HOME would be expanded):

          .bmark-cd:

               alias cdu="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/"
               alias cdst="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/"
               alias cdsts="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/st-ss20-harder-heinen/"
               alias cdstm="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/materialien/"

          .bmark-cd_vifm:

               alias ccu="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/; vifm ."
               alias ccst="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/; vifm ."
               alias ccsts="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/st-ss20-harder-heinen/; vifm ."
               alias ccstm="cd $HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/materialien/; vifm ."

          VIFM_bookmarks:

               bmark! "$HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/" ccu
               bmark! "$HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/" ccst
               bmark! "$HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/st-ss20-harder-heinen/" ccsts
               bmark! "$HOME/Documents/University/classes/semester-4/softwaretechnik/materialien/" ccstm

     To manage bookmarks in an organized fashion, simply spread them into
     several files:

          $> cat general_bmarks.txt soho_locations.txt university.txt | mkbmark
