Fundamentally this is just a UNIX manpage cloned without groff-styles.
Because of the style-less-ness I have added ":\n" after the Section Headlines.
There obviously isn't a header or footer.
Because these comments may be used as the helptexts I also renamed SYNOPSIS
with USAGE, that makes more sense.
These comments are used as helptexts because my scripts don't get their own man
pages.
Note also that I fold the lines to a length of 80 characters! No adjustments
like in man, hahahahahaha
