Scripts that just do some action are named in snake_case and end in .sh:

   suspend.sh
   wacom-toggle_touch.sh


Scripts that function as part of a pipeline are named in lowerCamelCase without
extension. They follow Haskell's naming convention, as the UNIX pipe is
analogous to a kind of IO Monad:

   filterIncludeExclude
   linkFilesTo

Scripts / Commands that are used a lot may get aliases for convenience. These
should follow UNIX naming convention -- small lowercase abbreviations.


Comments in scripts should be sparse -- follow the suckless philosophy for the
code itself.  You are smart enough to look things up, if you don't quite
remember.

However there should be one man page comment, that includes a brief
description, a list of possible inputs and valid options.



Try to generalize all commands. Also try to think about all the different input
means -- arguments, pipes, etc -- to make a UNIX utility: does one thing, but
does it well, by having a simple interface and a sensible feature set.

The generalization is also why we define command families.
