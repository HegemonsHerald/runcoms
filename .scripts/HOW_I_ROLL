Scripts that just do some action are named in snake_case and end in .sh:

   suspend.sh
   wacom-toggle_touch.sh


Scripts that function as part of a pipeline are named in lowerCamelCase without
extension. They follow Haskell's naming convention, as the UNIX pipe is
analogous to a kind of IO Monad:

   filterIncludeExclude
   linkFilesTo


Comments in scripts should be sparse -- follow the suckless philosophy for the
code itself.  You are smart enough to look things up, if you don't quite
remember.
However there should be one man page comment, that includes a brief
description, a list of possible inputs and valid options.
