# Wheeeeee Obligatory Runcoms Yay

**Note to self:** If you have thingies, that are user/platform-specific and can't be decided by an if clause (eg wm-config), put that stuff in a folder like this:
`'THING-OS-USER/...'` and treat that location as if it were the $HOME dir of the USER on the OS!

**Note to self:** You are using hard symbolic links for the files in here. Hard symlinks won't do directories, so keep that in mind. And on the mac for some reason the symlinked versions of the files won't update to changes from the repo-versions, but it works very much in the other direction!
