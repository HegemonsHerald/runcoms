# Wheeeeee Obligatory Runcoms Yay

**Note to self:** If you have thingies, that are user/platform-specific and can't be decided by an if clause (eg wm-config), put that stuff in a folder like this:
`'THING-OS-USER/...'` and treat that location as if it were the $HOME dir of the USER on the OS!

### How I Roll -- Scripts

Custom scripts and utilities go into .scripts/.  
They are named in lowerCamelCase and are written in a (mostly) functional style.  
For convenience the commands get UNIX-like aliases, eg `fdPlay` has the alias `fdplay`.
