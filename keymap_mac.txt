Ahoy, I changed up my keymap!

What I functionally did is this: I removed the behaviour that the Option or Alt key makes certain keys
enter special characters. Instead it now sends the appropriate keycodes!

I did this using a tool called Ukelele.app. Ukelele is a keymap editor for mac, which uses XML based
keymaps.

The keymaps you export from Ukelele you can put into the folder '~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/'. Afterwards
you can select them from the System Preferences' Keyboard Layout selector.

Using Ukelele:

  Create a new keymap with: 'File > New from current Input Source'
  This keymap will mirror, what you already got.
  You can then press the target Key Combination, which will be highlighted in Ukelele.
  Select the Combo by pressing on it. If you double-click you can edit the settings.

  By default the Alt Combos are 'Dead Keys', they have to be enabled by setting them to an 'Output Key'.
  When prompted for input you can put in the thing you pressed to get to the Combo's settings.

  Eg: press Option-j, enable that dead key combo, set it to an output key and press Option-j again to enter,
  what the system should send to applications.


  It's quite helpful to change the keymap's name to something useful.
  Use: 'Keyboard > Set Keyboard Name and Script...' to do that.
