# Zsh settings
# make completion be case-insensitive
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' '+m:{A-Z}={a-z}'
#  zstyle defines lookup styles for zsh.
#  These are context-related and change the behaviour of shell
#  functions, that look, which styles are defined.
#  The completion system uses styles for its completion behaviour and
#  output.
#  The context for the compsys is ':completion:', ':completion:*'
#  matches all other fields of the zstyle commands, for you can get
#  awfully specific using thoseâ€¦
#  The 'matcher-list' is a set of style-rules applied to all completers
#  whenever a completion takes place. 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' matches lowercase
#  letters to their uppercase counterparts, when the lowercase letters
#  don't return a match. '+m:{A-Z}={a-z}' does the same in the other
#  direction, the '+' adds this rule to the previous instead of
#  overwriting it.
